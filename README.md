# Mean Sea Surface, Gravity, and Bathymetry Prediction Workshop
## Objectives: The main objective of this workshop is to develop best practices for predicting bathymetry from a combination of sparse ship soundings and marine gravity from SWOT altimetry. A secondary objective is to develop best practices for constructing a mean sea surface (MSS) and other gravity products from SWOT.


## Prediction Competition: During the workshop we will have an informal competition using three data sets: SWOT gravity, SRTM soundings (training data), and unique GEBCO soundings (evaluation data). Participants can use any other data/information but will not have access to the unique GEBCO soundings which will be used for evaluation.

### We will use the global predicted bathymetry published by Harper et al., 2023 as a baseline. It uses a straightforward ML approach and the pre-SWOT gravity.  Here is a link to that paper.
